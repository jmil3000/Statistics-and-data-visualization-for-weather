# Statistics-and-data-visualization-for-weather
This was my project for ECE 3710, Statistics and Probability for Engineers. It runs through various statistics and visualizations for the dataset and outputs them. The dataset includes the average daily temperature in Orem, Utah for the first 3 months of 2022.
The last bit of code is using the calculated statistics to predict the tempuratures for the next 3 months of next year
